# Landing-Page
This Project is part of the Odin-Project course work and involves replicating an entire web page based off of a specific design / template.

This will be a solid test of my html and css skills and a good chance to consolidate what I have learnt so far in the course. Also, this will be a good chance to re-familiurise my self with git.
